## 🔍 Project Overview

This project introduces a unified, zero-emission system design to power offshore oil and gas platforms using wind energy and distributed storage systems. The framework uniquely integrates wind uncertainty analysis with a robust hybrid energy system architecture, entirely eliminating fossil fuel backups.
Key components include:
- 🌬️ **Wind Uncertainty Analysis**: Based on metocean data from 23 offshore U.S. sites (West Coast, East Coast, Gulf of Mexico), analyzing wind speed distributions, extreme events, and site-specific variability.
- ⚡ **Energy System Architecture**: Wind turbines coupled with distributed energy storage, coordinated by a centralized control system.
- 📉 **Resilience Focus**: System designed to minimize power downtimes and handle aleatoric uncertainty in offshore wind patterns.
- 🌱 **Zero-Emission Constraint**: No fossil backup; continuous power delivery from renewable sources only.


### ✅ Simulation Highlights

- 🔻 50% reduction in power downtimes  
- 🔺 80.88% improvement in energy stability across test scenarios
